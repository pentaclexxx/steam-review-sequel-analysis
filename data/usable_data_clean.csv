"76561197993515393",NA,"Mista","I actually wanted to make this review negative after playing for quite some time, but I changed my mind after finishing it.

I didn't really have too great of a time mostly. Scary cannibals stop being scary pretty fast and then they are just a nuisance. Game is heavily exploration focused, which I like a lot in games, but visiting each and every cave wasn't bringing me any sense of fulfillment, I was just going around identical looking places, going in circles, sometimes finding something useful and then going out in an undisclosed place. Due to you being actually required to explore the caves to progress, investing time in creating actual working base seemed to be completely pointless and most of the time temporary shelter was just enough. But I had enough fun with my friends playing coop to continue and finally we've reached the only redeeming quality I can talk about in this game, which is the very last section of the game, which was really, really good and climatic. The endings are also a whole different story, especially with one of the endings not actually ending the game, thus not unlocking creative mode - it just progresses like nothing happened.

The last section was good enough for me giving a thumbs up on this game, though. For this part only I recommend visiting The Forest.",1614021089,"upvote",0,0,0,0,1

The game is more fun played with friends, but is also enjoyable in a lone wolf experiences. You can design and build some pretty good base.

"76561198363680967",NA,"TheLegendofZach","This is no Sons of the Forest. This game, instead of harsh but recoverable difficulty, instead featured cruel, laborious, and non-customizable core mechanics. The brutal ""survival"" had me consistently 1-shot by a boss which repeated the same boring and slow 3-hit attack pattern. However, thanks to a friend, I was able to be revived multiple times throughout the fight, until my friend was also 1-shot. Because of the cruel survival of The Forest, we both respawned without our inventory at low hunger/water, with broken limbs, and not in our beds (There is no setting new spawnpoints in this game). We both ran back for 5 minutes, and we save scummed to safely get our inventories back. The boss didn't kill us the second time around, although he would have 1-shot us if we did get hit, even though enemies around him took ~6 hits to kill us, evidence to us not being in a late zone.

When we got back, we worked on a base, which uncovered yet another annoying aspect of The Forest: base building. In order to build a base, everything had to first be blueprinted, then constructed with logs acquired from chopping trees. Despite the game being called ""The Forest,"" forestry is this game's second worst mechanic. Every tree took about 15 seconds to chop, and each tree dropped 4 logs, although only 2 could be carried at a time back to the blueprinted base. When I used the log sled, hitting a bit of terrain would recreate a bug similar Skyrim's famous flying giant bug, which launched me into the air and killed me. Anyways, the floor of the base took about an hour for me and the friend to get the logs for, and when we realized we placed our (non-recoverable) rope zip-line at the wrong location, we both collectively decided The Forest is not a fun game.

Also, The Forest has received no updates since 2019. The flying log sled bug has not and never will be fixed, and no official improvements will ever be made for this game. There are at least 138 other bugs mentioned and ignored on the Fandom wiki page. I have not played Sons of the Forest, but I probably never will because of the lack of care given to The Forest(a year after this game released it's ""1.0"" it was abandoned).",1738045227,"downvote",0,0,0,0,0

[hr][/hr]
Though I don't use to make long reviews, this time I'm making an exception.

[h3]Attention:[/h3] [u]Next, you will find some spoilers, so discretion is advised[/u]:

[b]Things I liked it[/b]
[list]
[*]Death mechanic: when you die by enemies (mainly) you don't watch a boring screen telling you which it's obvious. Instead, cannibals bring you to a cave where you can get back to game.

[*]Continuous threat: you can feel it in game everytime, because you are expose to encounter multiple enemies unexpectedly. And this is great!

[*]Unlike surface, caves can be clear of enemies so they won't respawn again (with some exceptions).

[*]Great atmosphere.

[*]Some curious items, like the cassette player.
[/list]

[b]Things could be better[/b]
[list]
[*]Game performance.

[*]Some bugs in game, and this is a 2018 game (final version)...

[*]Infinite loot, especially when you enter caves multiple times. This ""break"" a bit the ""survival experience"".

[*]No death penalty: if you die, you don't lose anything from your inventory, at least on singleplayer mode.

[*]If you are under attack, you can save and exit game to wipe the enemies. XD

[*]Construction is pretty basic: you just can build, but there is not option to remove structures (you have to destroy it), to change position, upgrade it, not even to recover some materials after destruction (no deconstruction).

[*]Light items can't be turned off, you need to destroy it, even the campfires!

[*]Despite of the expensive material requirement of some storage construtions, some of them have a poor storage capacity, and they take up too much space.

[*]Multiplayer is a pain (cheaters who ruin the game experience, or lack of active rooms).
[/list]

"76561198027829003",NA,"Girthquake","Okay I'm going to start off by saying that this game is really buggy but if you can look past that, what you will find is a solid survival experience, that is similar to don't starve in execution, although there isnt a sanity mechanic or any magic of sorts like in Don't starve. It makes up for that in the horror elements, But now for the problems with the game.

The Forest has a lot of problems, there needs to be Tweaks to the AI to make it respond to player behaivor better, There needs to be better progression with the tools the stone axe being essentially the same as the plane axe excluding the ability to block attacks, the rusty axe is easliy duplicated just by switching to something else. The flare gun has infinite flares and it makes you essentially invincible. The spider mutants are immune to the bombs and resist fire. and thats about it for this review if i were to give it a score it would score about a 8/10 with me.",1404581711,"upvote",1,0,0,1,0

It has loads of bugs to be honest,and it can get a little bit flustrating as i write this review after being killed 2 times in a row because of the cannibals hitting bugs.So you have to take it easy and calm.It's a good thing they introduced peaceful mode with the last update(0.03),and if you are new to the game i recomend playing on that mode and build a good base and some traps as they now come in a larger number than before.Speaking of a base the game construction system is unique and perfect as it is(i hope they will put more types of houses in future as they are only 4 now with the house boat that can't be built) and the trees chopping system will never get old :) Another thing that i hope they introduce is more animals that you can hunt instead of rabbits,lizards and fish,you are in a Forest why only so little variety of food you can gather? Another thing that i don't like is the way that cannibals are in this stage they really need to improve the way that they react and attack you.

I recomend this game to anyone that wants to be a survivor,it is a relaxing,fun and entertaining game if you play it on peaceful or even normal [spoiler] and when cannibals are cannibals not bombs that trow you 100 meters in the air. [\spoiler]",1404588569,"upvote",1,1,0,0,0

Needs a proper cheat system/consolecommand for resources to not only make the game fun, but also people will be able to find bugs quicker. I have plenty of ideas for crafting on the game, but with how long it takes to chop down trees/blow them up/glitch/etc. Im discouraged from playing much more with my playstyle and I speak for more than myself saying this. Game is currently too focused on gathering resources, thats the main thing to do in this game. Therefore nobodys going to find combat glitches or in depth building glitches that you would if people could just play the game in a debugging mode for example, theres already different modes for different playstyles so why not add a godmode or whatever you want to call it. Think about people who just get into the game and try to decide if its a keeper or a refund. Most of your first hours in game will typically be building stuff, you most likely won't explore much in the time it would take for a refund to become invalid. Therefore newcomers are of course scared of a 2+ year old game STILL in alpha with all the moneygrabs coming from EA. The graphics are crazy good for a $15 game, same can be said about AI even if it were a $60 game. Great online, hit detection, and some bugs can be avoided.

Plane snaps in half, but you're such a badass you are the only survivor and you're doing pretty damn well.  A blue electric guy comes and takes the kid next to you while you stare at him, but you stay silent, because Social Darwinism is life and you are going to amount to more than that child would have.  You wonder around hopeless and ravage through people's luggage because when sh** happens, common sense goes out the window.  You run aimlessly with an axe and kill a few monitor lizards because wherever you are, they are abundant.  Soon after, a little bronze person appears and stares at you, naturally you're instinct in unrealistic situations is to kill him.

"76561198009004334",NA,"atris13","This can be a fun game, but I think you have to play with friends. It's worth noting that I played as a guest with others and had no idea this game had an actual story. 
Potential Spoiler- As a guest, you get a slightly different intro, so I had no idea why I should find this Timmy kid on my objective list, it wasn't until I played some solo that I saw an alternative perspective and realized. I think this is a neat dynamic, but the lack of awareness for the game made it difficult to follow and I just thought it was a ""Rust"" like game.
This lack of story created an environment where we spent most of our play time cutting down forests and building bases, zip-lines, and other intricacies before one of my party started reading online... Then it all changed. We went from trying to manage our village to exploring and achieving goals. These goals and my companions understanding of the game gave us purpose and this is when I started to enjoy the game...
Until we ran into several glitches and issues (destroyed points for one do not mean everyone sees it destroyed or your location may not match up with some locations of items- reloading fixed many issues by resetting values. Another issue was achievement tracking in the system didn't register so for some doing this, you may have to host a separate game to get those that don't register correctly). We worked through them, but these issues can severely disrupt the enjoyable nature of the game.
One key takeaway for those willing to brave the game- guest saves are separate from the host... so if the guest saves and the host reverts their save, the guest maintains everything. This is nice for guests.
If it weren't for the multiple bugs, I would definitely rate this more favorably, but it's still an enjoyable game with a good group.",1642214814,"downvote",1,1,1,0,0

 Played for 5 minutes before being scared so bad i screamed (6' full grown man) by the sound of something RUNNING UP BEHIND ME never have i cursed the day i installed surround sound, i knew exactly where he was coming from and somehow that creeped me out even more

i walked towards him and he ran away

so i went back to the plane and grabbed the axe

3 minutes later he came back with friends
i killed them all

5 minutes later some insane guy came sprinting at me and then ran and jumped into the trees

right after he left more insane people came, i was outnumbered and terrified so i quit (im not proud of that) will play again later after my heart rate subsides

5/5 atmosphere
5/5 fighting
5/5 creepout factor

Everything is here to remind you that the surrounding nature will do everything to destroy your morale and your life. Oppressive, stressful, but so exhilarating. In a genre that is filled to the brim with many different titles all competing to be the best, The Forest certainly sets itself apart. It's hard, terrifying, and grim but also rewarding in its own right. Each death taught me a new lesson such as; how many damages each cannibal does, how fast some of them are, and how some are them are ""fakers"" too. There's a ton of customization and crafting to be done, and the areas that can be explored are very well made. The best part of this is that there is no single right way to play as you can tackle the game's happening's in any way you want. Anyone who likes crafting, survival, and possibly being eaten by cannibals (or eating the cannibals) should give this game a whirl. 8/10 would fu*k Megan.",1595745318,"upvote",1,1,0,1,1
